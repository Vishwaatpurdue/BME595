# Assumptions:
[item 1][bold] 1. In NeuralNetwork API, hidden layers passed as the parameters for init does not include the bias term for each layer.
[item 2][bold] 2. In NeuralNetwork API, weights for the bias term is considered as per the requirements provided in the instruction(this is included in the random distribution).
[item 3][bold] 3. In LogicGates API, the input can be array as well as list.


To test the API, a test script is generated and all the test cases are analysed. Only the results are printed. 
To execute the test script, open the test script in any python IDE and run it. Else use a terminal window and type "$ python testscript.py"
It will print the inputs and the outputs correspondingly. Both batch operation and single operation are tested.
